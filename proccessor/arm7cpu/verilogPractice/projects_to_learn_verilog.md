### **Tips for Implementation**:
1. Start with a clear block diagram of your design.
2. Write testbenches for each module to verify functionality.
3. Use simulation tools like ModelSim or Vivado to debug your designs.
4. Gradually increase complexity by combining smaller modules into larger systems.

By working through these projects, you’ll gain confidence in Verilog and be well-prepared to tackle more complex CPU components. Good luck!
